PaddlePaddle (PArallel Distributed Deep LEarning) is a
simple, efficient and extensible deep learning framework.

Please refer to  `PaddlePaddle Github <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle>`_ for details, and  `Release Note <../release_note_en.html>`_ for features incorporated in current version.

Let's start with studying basic concept of PaddlePaddle:

- `Model Development <./beginner/index_en.html>`_
- `More Uses for Model Development <./advanced/index_en.html>`_
- `Dygraph to Static Graph <./jit/index_en.html>`_ : Introduce the transformation of dygraph to static graph.
- `Inference and Deployment <./infer/index_en.html>`_ : Introduce the method of using the trained model to inference.
- `Distributed Training <./06_distributed_training/index_en.html>`_ : Introduce how the PaddlePaddle uses distributed training
- `Performance Improving <./performance_improving/index_en.html>`_ : Introduce how to improve performance of PaddlePaddle.
- `Model Convert <./model_convert/index_en.html>`_ : Introduce how to convert your model to PaddlePaddle.
- `FLAGS <./flags/flags_en.html>`_ : Introduce the envirenment flags in paddle.
