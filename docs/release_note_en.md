# 3.0 Beta Release Note

# Overview of PaddlePaddle 3.0 Beta

The core features of this version mainly include new technologies such as dynamic-static unity auto parallel and automatic optimization of neural network compiler, to aim to address the new challenges in the current deep learning field.PaddlePaddle Framework 3.0 Beta extends the design concepts of 2.x such as dynamic-static unity and integrated training and inference. The development interface is fully compatible with 2.x version. This means that codes developed in version 2.x can run directly on version 3.x without modification in most cases. Several key features are detailed as follows:

- Dynamic-static graph unified auto parallel: To make the parallel training programming of large models easier, PaddlePaddle has also optimized the semi-auto parallel programming paradigm with dynamic-static graph unified. Developers do not need to delve into the complex concepts and APIs need in manual parallel programming; developers only need to perform a small amount of tensor sharding annotation to complete the construction of hybrid parallelism for large models. The framework is able to automatically derive distributed sharding states and add communication operators, and also supports one-key dynamic-to-static distributed training, thus dramatically simplifying the development of hybrid parallel training codes. In terms of dynamic-static unity, PaddlePaddle has comprehensively upgraded its dynamic-to-static training capability by adopting bytecode-based dynamic-static conversion technology, to support adaptive graph construction functions. It has been verified on more than 700 PaddlePaddle industrial-grade models, achieving a 100% success rate of one-key dynamic-to-static training.
- Automatic optimization of neural network compiler: PaddlePaddle Compiler Infrastructure for Neural Networks (CINN) adopts the design of integration with the framework, supporting the efficient training and dynamic shape inference of generative models, scientific computing models and other models. This provides a good balance between computational flexibility and high performance. The inference performance of Llama2 and Stable Diffusion models has been improved by 30% through automatic fusion of operators and code generation technology.
- High-order automatic differentiation: In order to better support scientific computing scenarios, PaddlePaddle Framework designs and implements high-order automatic differentiation technology based on combinatorial operator mechanism, combined with automatic optimization technology of neural network compiler. We have tested more than 40 differential equations in scientific computing scenarios, and its solution speed is 70% ahead of similar products in the industry.
- Highly scalable intermediate representation: In order to improve the scalability of the PaddlePaddle framework, we have developed a highly scalable Paddle Intermediate Representation (PIR).This representation systematically abstracts the underlying core concepts and provides flexible and efficient components. PIR serves as the infrastructure to support a number of technologies such as dynamic-to-static, automatic differentiation, auto parallel, combinatorial operators, and graph optimization; it is widely used in scenarios such as distributed training, model compression, and inference deployment. With the Declarative Rewrite Rule (DRR) mechanism provided by PIR, the development cost of Pass can be reduced by 60%.We have tested over 900 model configurations and the results show that the overall performance of inference improves by more than 10% after using PIR.
- Multi-Hardware adaptation: PaddlePaddle provides a well-functioning and low-cost solution for large model hardware adaptation. The new hardware only needs to be adapted with more than 30 interfaces to support training, compression and inference of large models. Meanwhile, PaddlePaddle provides compiler-based hardware access mode, and hardware vendors only need to implement the compiler's code generation back-end in the form of plug-ins to achieve efficient adaptation with the PaddlePaddle framework.PaddlePaddle hardware access this time has additional support for the daily release of four hardware units: Kunlun XPU, Ascend NPU, Hygon DCU and Cambricon MLU.

This version includes the continuous improvement of some of the existing features of the framework 2.x. Meanwhile, the new features of this version bring significant improvements in terms of user experience, performance, ease of secondary development and hardware adaptability. In addition to the above core features, this version continues to enrich and enhance the API functions to meet more scenarios at the user experience level, optimizes and improves the distributed parallel strategy optimization and reasoning function enhancement for the large model scenarios, makes thorough improvement in terms of ease-of-use in compilation and installation, makes a new synchronous upgrade to the installation method and version of the dependency packages, strengthens the security of the system comprehensively, and makes comprehensive error-correction checks to the product documentation. We have also carried out a cleanup of some deprecated codes to ensure architectural simplicity. The performance of PaddlePaddle 3.0 Beta is still mature and stable without the use of new features, and each new feature provides a switch for flexible control, which makes it easy for users to quickly understand the related product features and experience comparison.

## User Experience Upgrade

### Incompatibility Upgrade

- PaddlePaddle API supports type promotion.In the most common calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, if the two inputs are of different data types, it is necessary to determine the data type of the output. Historically, PaddlePaddle partially supported this and the actual rules were not clear. Objectively, there were dynamic-static inconsistency, inconsistent API and operator overloading, and inconsistent interchange rates, and unexpected problems (hard to fix) especially in the case of large models using a mix of bf16/fp16 and fp32 for a wide range of calculations. Starting from the 3.0 beta, PaddlePaddle has clarified the [type promotion rules](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/develop/guides/advanced/auto_type_promotion_cn.html), and defined in detail the types of Tensor vs Tensor and Tensor vs. 1 number (Scalar) computation results, ensuring that the computation conforms to the exchange law, the operator overloading is consistent with the results of the binary API, and the results of the dynamic graph are consistent with those of the static graph. This is more in line with user understanding and industry practice. [#60638](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/pull/60638), [#63842](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/pull/63842), [#60011](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/pull/60011)

### Deprecated Features

- There have been two versions stably supporting 0-dimensional Tensor. This version removes the switch `FLAGS_set_to_1d` that converts a 0-dimensional Tensor to a 1-dimensional Tensor with only 1 element in some cases. This switch is for compatibility with the incorrect way of writing a 1-element 1-dimensional Tensor to represent a 0-dimensional Tensor in some kits. That is, the current PaddlePaddle fully distinguish between the semantics of a 0-dimensional Tensor and a 1-dimensional Tensor with only 1 element, both are not equivalent. [#61227](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/pull/61227)

## Basic Execution Architecture

PIR basic functions have been upgraded and improved comprehensively, and the maturity level has been greatly improved. Based on PIR, the design of the PaddlePaddle infrastructure is more reasonable, ensuring the excellent performance and good scalability of the framework. In this version, we have completed the inference verification of PIR in multiple scenarios: For the single-machine scenario, complete the PIR back-end switching in the dynamic-to-static scenarios; For inference scenario, complete the verification of all the stock models, and 84.2% of the models have a gain of 10%+; we have completed the verification of distributed scenarios based on PIR. Meanwhile, based on PIR, we have completed the development and validation of core modules such as control flow, backward logic, save/load, and OneDNN adaptation, which lays a solid foundation for the switching of the PaddlePaddle PIR to the default mode. The functional completeness, execution efficiency and stability of the PaddlePaddle framework operator system are further improved, bringing better use and development experience to the developers.

### Function Optimization

## Compiler Infrastructure for Neural Networks (CINN)

In version 3.0, the compiler architecture has been significantly upgraded. Based on Shape Dialect, build a symbolic automatic derivation and simplification system, support symbolic expression and constraint construction, and support end-to-end execution under the dynamic shape of the compiler. Meanwhile, CINN has upgraded the automatic fusion of subgraphs and Pass Pipline mechanism, merged the core modules of dynamic and static shapes, and merged the iteration paths, so that the architecture is clear and unified. In this version, the compiler has been refactored in important back-end modules such as AST Compute, Schedule strategy, and Tiling, improving the general optimization capability of the compiler, and verifies the training, inference correctness and speedup performance of the dynamic shapes on the subgraphs of PaddlePaddle Industry Suite models and typical large models Llama2-7B and Stable Diffusion models.

## Auto-Parallel Architecture

In order to further enhance the usability of the Auto Parallel architecture in large model training scenarios, PaddlePaddle has improved the Auto Parallel functionality in dynamic-static graphs, including the newly added parallel strategies such as sharding parallelism and interleaved pipeline parallelism, including support of lazy initialization parameters. Add and enhance the SPMD derivation rules for some of the operators. The auto-parallel architecture has been comprehensively verified in a number of mainstream large language models. Meanwhile, in order to build the new 3.0 architecture of PaddlePaddle, the static graph auto parallel architecture has been comprehensively upgraded based on PIR, the new generation intermediate representation of Paddlepaddle. It introduces DistDialect for distributed related components, and natively support DistAttr and DistTensor in the computation graph representation, and smooth the transfom from static to dynmaic graph, further enhance the unity of auto parallel usage in dynamic and static graph mode. Finally, a number of performance optimization technologies have been added and improved, including zero bubble pipeline scheduling strategy, achieving the same or even better end-to-end training performance compared to the manual parallelism on typical large models such as Llama-2 13B/70B.
