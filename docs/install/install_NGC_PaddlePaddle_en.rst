NGC PaddlePaddle Container Installation Guide
==============================================

----------------------
  Overview
----------------------

The PaddlePaddle NGC Container is optimized for GPU acceleration, and contains a validated set of libraries that enable and optimize GPU performance. This container may also contain modifications to the PaddlePaddle source code in order to maximize performance and compatibility. This container also contains software for accelerating ETL (`DALI <https://developer.nvidia.com/dali/>`_, `RAPIDS <https://rapids.ai/>`_), Training(`cuDNN <https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn>`_, `NCCL <https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl>`_), and Inference(`TensorRT <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html>`_) workloads。

------------------------------------------
  Environmental preparation
------------------------------------------

Using the PaddlePaddle NGC Container requires the host system to have the following installed:

* `Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_

* `NVIDIA GPU Drivers <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html>`_

* `NVIDIA Container Toolkit <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_

For supported versions, see the `Framework Containers Support Matrix <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html>`_ and the `NVIDIA Container Toolkit Documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html>`_ .

No other installation, compilation, or dependency management is required. It is not necessary to install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.

----------------------
  Installation
----------------------

To run a container, issue the appropriate command as explained in the `Running A Container <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/user-guide/index.html#runcont>`_ chapter in the NVIDIA Containers For Deep Learning Frameworks User’s Guide and specify the registry, repository, and tags. For more information about using NGC, refer to the `NGC Container User Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-catalog-user-guide/index.html>`_ .
If you have Docker 19.03 or later, a typical command to launch the container is:


    ::

        docker run --gpus all --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/paddlepaddle:yy.mm-py3


If you have Docker 19.02 or earlier, a typical command to launch the container is:


    ::

        nvidia-docker run --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/paddlepaddle:yy.mm-py3



Where:

* yy.mm is the container version, e.g., the version published in Sept 2022 is 22.09.

PaddlePaddle is run by importing it as a Python module:


    ::

        $ python -c 'import paddle; paddle.utils.run_check()'
       Running verify PaddlePaddle program ...

       PaddlePaddle works well on 8 GPUs.
       PaddlePaddle is installed successfully! Let's start deep learning with PaddlePaddle now.

See /workspace/README.md inside the container for information on getting started and customizing your PaddlePaddle image.

You might want to pull in data and model descriptions from locations outside the container for use by PaddlePaddle. To accomplish this, the easiest method is to mount one or more host directories as `Docker bind mounts <https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/>`_. For example:

    ::

        docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v local_dir:container_dir nvcr.io/nvidia/paddlepaddle:22.07-py3


Note: In order to share data between ranks, NCCL may require shared system memory for IPC and pinned (page-locked) system memory resources. The operating system's limits on these resources may need to be increased accordingly. Refer to your system's documentation for details. In particular, Docker containers default to limited shared and pinned memory resources. When using NCCL inside a container, it is recommended that you increase these resources by issuing:


    ::

        --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1

in the docker run command.
