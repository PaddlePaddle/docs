# **Install on MacOS via Docker**

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is an open source application container engine. Using docker, you can not only isolate the installation and use of paddlepaddle from the system environment, but also share GPU, network and other resources with the host.
In the following Docker installation and use process, a specific version of PaddlePaddle has been installed in docker.

## Environment preparation

- MacOS version 10.x/11.x (64 bit)(not support GPU version)

- On the local host [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- Python version in the image is 3.7

## Installation steps

### 1. Pull PaddlePaddle image

For domestic users, when downloading docker is slow due to network problems, you can use the mirror provided by Baidu:

* CPU version of PaddlePaddle：
    ```
    docker pull registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2
    ```

* CPU version of PaddlePaddle, and the image is pre-installed with jupyter：
    ```
    docker pull registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2-jupyter
    ```

If your machine is not in mainland China, you can pull the image directly from DockerHub:

* CPU version of PaddlePaddle：
    ```
    docker pull paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2
    ```

* CPU version of PaddlePaddle, and the image is pre-installed with jupyter：
    ```
    docker pull paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2-jupyter
    ```

You can see [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paddlepaddle/paddle/tags/) to get more images.

### 2. Build and enter Docker container

* Use CPU version of PaddlePaddle：



    ```
    docker run --name paddle_docker -it -v $PWD:/paddle registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2 /bin/bash
    ```

    - `--name paddle_docker`: set name of Docker, `paddle_docker` is name of docker you set;


    - `-it`: The parameter indicates that the container has been operated interactively with the local machine;


    - `-v $PWD:/paddle`: Specifies to mount the current path of the host (PWD variable in Linux will expand to the absolute path of the current path) to the /paddle directory inside the container;

    - `registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2`: Specify the name of the image to be used. You can view it through the 'docker images' command. /bin/Bash is the command to be executed in Docker


* Use CPU version of PaddlePaddle with jupyter：


    ```
    mkdir ./jupyter_docker
    ```
    ```
    chmod 777 ./jupyter_docker
    ```
    ```
    cd ./jupyter_docker
    ```
    ```
    docker run -p 80:80 --rm --env USER_PASSWD="password you set" -v $PWD:/home/paddle registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2-jupyter
    ```

    - `--rm`: Delete the container after closing it;


    - `--env USER_PASSWD="password you set"`: Set the login password for jupyter, `password you set` is the password you set;


    - `-v $PWD:/home/paddle`: Specifies to mount the current path (the PWD variable will be expanded to the absolute path of the current path) to the /home/paddle directory inside the container;

    - `registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2-jupyter`: Specify the name of the image to be used, you can view it through the `docker images` command



Now you have successfully used Docker to install PaddlePaddle. For more information about using Docker, see[Docker official documents](https://docs.docker.com)

<p align="center">
<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th> Mirror source </th>
        <th> Mirror description </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td> registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2 </td>
        <td> CPU image with 2.4.2 version of paddle installed </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2-jupyter </td>
        <td> CPU image of paddle version 2.4.2 is installed, and jupyter is pre-installed in the image. Start the docker to run the jupyter service </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</p>

You can find the docker mirroring of the published versions of PaddlePaddle in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paddlepaddle/paddle/tags/).

## Supplement

* When you need to enter the docker container for the second time, use the following command:

    Container created before startup
    ```
    docker start <Name of container>
    ```

    Enter the starting container
    ```
    docker attach <Name of container>
    ```

* If you are a newcomer to Docker, you can refer to the materials on the Internet for learning, such as [Docker tutorial](http://www.runoob.com/docker/docker-hello-world.html)

## How to uninstall

After entering the Docker container, execute the following command:

* **CPU version of PaddlePaddle**:
    ```
    pip uninstall paddlepaddle
    ```

Or delete the docker container directly through `docker rm <Name of container>`
