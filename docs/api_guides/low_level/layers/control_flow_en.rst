Control Flow
#############

In programming languages, the control flow determines the order in which statements are executed. Common control flows contain sequential execution, branching, and looping. PaddlePaddle Fluid inherits this concept and provides a variety of control flow APIs to control the execution logic of the deep learning model during training or prediction.

IfElse
======

Conditional branch, for the input of a batch, according to the given conditions, select the process in :code:`true_block` or :code:`false_block` to execute respectively, and then merge the outputs of the two branches into one after the execution. In general, conditional expressions can be generated by a logical comparison API such as :ref:`api_fluid_layers_less_than`, :ref:`api_fluid_layers_equal`.

Please refer to :ref:`api_fluid_layers_IfElse`

**Note:** A new OP :ref:`api_fluid_layers_cond` is highly recommended instead of ``IfElse`` . OP :ref:`api_fluid_layers_cond` is easier to use and is called with less code but does the same thing as ``IfElse`` .

Switch
======

Switch, like the :code:`switch-case` declaration commonly found in programming languages, selects different branch to execute depending on the value of the input expression. Specifically, the :code:`Switch` control flow defined by Fluid has the following characteristics:

* The condition of the case is a bool type value, which is a tensor type Variable in the Program;
* It checks each case one by one, selects the first case that satisfies the condition, and exits the block after completion of the execution;
* If all cases do not meet the conditions, the default case will be selected for execution.

Please refer to :ref:`api_fluid_layers_Switch`

**Note:** A new OP :ref:`api_fluid_layers_case` is highly recommended instead of ``Switch`` . OP :ref:`api_fluid_layers_case` is easier to use and is called with less code but does the same thing as ``Switch`` .

While
=====

When the condition is true, repeatedly execute logic in the :code:`block` which :code:`While` flow belongs to until the condition is judged to be false and the loop will be ended. The related APIs are as follows:

* :ref:`api_fluid_layers_increment` : It is usually used to count the number of loops;
* :ref:`api_fluid_layers_array_read` : Reads Variable from the specified location in :code:`LOD_TENSOR_ARRAY` to perform calculations;
* :ref:`api_fluid_layers_array_write` : Writes the Variable back to the specified location in :code:`LOD_TENSOR_ARRAY` and stores the result of the calculation.

Please refer to :ref:`api_fluid_layers_While`

**Note**: A new OP :ref:`api_fluid_layers_while_loop` is highly recommended instead of ``While`` . OP :ref:`api_fluid_layers_while_loop` is easier to use and is called with less code but does the same thing as ``While`` .


DynamicRNN
==========

Dynamic RNN can process a batch of unequal(variable)-length sequence data, which accepts the variable with :code:`lod_level=1` as input. In the :code:`block` of :code:`DynamicRNN`, the user needs to customize RNN's single-step calculation logic. At each time step, the user can write the state to be remembered to the :code:`memory` of :code:`DynamicRNN` and write the required output to its :code:`output`.

:ref:`api_fluid_layers_sequence_last_step` gets the output of the last time step of :code:`DynamicRNN`.

Please refer to :ref:`api_fluid_layers_DynamicRNN`

StaticRNN
=========

Static RNN can only process fixed-length sequence data, and accept Variable with :code:`lod_level=0` as input. Similar to :code:`DynamicRNN`, at each single time step of the RNN, the user needs to customize the calculation logic and export the status and output.
