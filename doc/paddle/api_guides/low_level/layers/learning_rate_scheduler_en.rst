Learning rate scheduler
########################

When we use a method such as the gradient descent method to train the model, the training speed and loss are generally taken into consideration to select a relatively appropriate learning rate. However, if a fixed learning rate is used throughout the training process, the loss of the training set will not continue to decline after falling to a certain extent, but will 'jump' within a certain range. The jumping principle is shown in the figure below. When the loss function converges to the local minimum value, the update step will be too large due to the excessive learning rate. The parameter update will repeatedly *jump over* the local minimum value and an oscillation-like phenomenon will occur.

The learning rate scheduler defines a commonly used learning rate decay strategy to dynamically generate the learning rate. The learning rate decay function takes epoch or step as the parameter and returns a learning rate that gradually decreases with training. Thereby it reduces the training time and finds the local minimum value at the same time.
