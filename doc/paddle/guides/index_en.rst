PaddlePaddle (PArallel Distributed Deep LEarning) is a
simple, efficient and extensible deep learning framework.

Please refer to  `PaddlePaddle Github <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle>`_ for details, and  `Release Note <../release_note_en.html>`_ for features incorporated in current version.

Let's start with studying basic concept of PaddlePaddle:

- `Introduction to Tensor <tensor_introduction_en.html>`_ : Introduction of Tensor, which is the representation of data in Paddle.
- `broadcasting <./broadcasting_en.html>`_ : Introduction of broadcasting.
- `migration tools <./migration_en.html>`_：how to use migration tools to upgrade your code.
- `dynamic to static <./dygraph_to_static/index_en.html>`_：how to convert your model from dynamic graph to static graph.
