## **Forward-looking Preview**

- The PaddlePaddle Framework plans to drop the support for python2 and python3.5 from a certain version in the future. It is recommended that you upgrade python to V3.8 for PaddlePaddle.
- The PaddlePaddle Framework plans to drop the support for CUDA 9.0 from a certain version in the future. It is recommended that you upgrade the CUDA for PaddlePaddle.

## **Training Framework**

### **Compatibility instructions**

- Programming paradigm: PaddlePaddle 2.0.0 has the imperative programming paradigm (dynamic graphs) enabled by default, but still retains support for static graphs. static graph code (including static graph code from version 1.8) can be executed by running paddle. enable_static().
- API: The PaddlePaddle Framework Version 2.0.0 recommends users to use the API located in the paddle root directory, while all the APIs from version 1.x are retained in the paddle.fluid directory, retaining support for the API system of earlier versions. Therefore, the static graph training code version 1.x can run normally on version 2.0.0 by running paddle.enable_static(). The model saved by training of version 1.x can be used for inference in version 2.0.0.
- A [table](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/develop/guides/09_others_information/api_mapping_cn.html) of correspondence from version 1.8 API to version 2.0 API is prepared.
- We provide a migration tool to facilitate the migration of codes based on earlier version to codes of version 2.0.0. See Version Migration Tool.

### **dynamic graph mode**

By default, the dynamic graph mode is enabled for model development and training, which allows you to perform model deployment and training acceleration in the dynamic-to-static mode.For details, please see [dynamic graph](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/develop/tutorial/quick_start/dynamic_graph/dynamic_graph.html), [Dynamic-to-static graph](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/develop/guides/04_dygraph_to_static/index_cn.html).

###  **API system**

  - API directory structure adjustment: The API V1.x is mainly located in the paddle.fluid directory. In this version, the API directory structure is adjusted so that the classification can be more reasonable. For the specific adjusted directory, see the [API documentation](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/en/develop/api/index_en.html).  
  - Added 186 new APIs. Fixed and revised 260 APIs. See Release Notes of 2.0.0 pre release version and [API documentation](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/en/develop/api/index_en.html).

  - Added PaddlePaddle high-level API, and encapsulated the common operations such as networking, training, evaluation, prediction, access, etc. in the process of model development, to achieve low code development. See [PaddlePaddle high level API instructions](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/develop/tutorial/quick_start/high_level_api/high_level_api.html).

## **Known Issues**

- Due to cuDNN 8.0.x's own limitations, when using cuDNN 8.0.x to compile inference library and not using TensorRT acceleration, there is performance degradation on many models. This bug is to be fixed in cuDNN's subsequent versions. You can try to use TensorRT acceleration or use cuDNN 7.6.
- Due to cuDNN 8.0.x’s own limitation, memory leak occurs in some models when using cuDNN 8.0.x for inference. Currently, it is found that the problem occurs when the convolutionBiasActivationForward of cuDNN is used. You can try to disable conv_elementwise_add_act_fuse_pass and conv_elementwise_add_act_fuse_pass by using the inference config file config. pass_builder()->DeletePass().If there is still leakage, you can try cuDNN7.6 and send us the model where you found the problem by issue for analysis.
