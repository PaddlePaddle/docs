Let's start with studying basic concept of PaddlePaddle:

- `Basic Concept <../beginners_guide/basic_concept/index_en.html>`_ ： introduce the basic concept and usage of Paddle

If you have mastered the basic concept of Paddle and you expect to model and build your own network according to the actual problems, you can refer to some details of the use of paddle in the Coding Practice :

- `Coding Practice <../beginners_guide/coding_practice/index_en.html>`_ ： introduce how to model and build your own network for practical problems
