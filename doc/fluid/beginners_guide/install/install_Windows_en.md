# **Install under Windows**

This instruction will show you how to install PaddlePaddle on a 64-bit desktop or laptop and Windows. The Windows systems we support must meet the following requirements.


Please note: Attempts on other systems may cause the installation to fail. Please ensure that your environment meets the conditions. The installation we provide by default requires your computer processor to support the AVX instruction set. Otherwise, please select the version of `no_avx` in [the multi-version whl package installation list](Tables.html/#ciwhls):

Windows can use software such as `cpu-z` to detect whether your processor supports the AVX instruction set.

The current version does not support NCCL, distributed, AVX, warpctc and MKL related functions.
