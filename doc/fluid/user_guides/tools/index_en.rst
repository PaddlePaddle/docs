Basic Deep Learning Models
############################

This section collects 8 documents arranging from the simplest to the most challenging, which will guide you through the basic deep learning tasks in PaddlePaddle.

The documentation in this chapter covers a lot of deep learning basics and how to implement them with PaddlePaddle. See the instructions below for how to use:


Overview
======================

The book you are reading is an "interactive" e-book - each chapter can be run in a Jupyter Notebook.

    fit_a_line/README.md
    recognize_digits/README.md
    image_classification/index_en.md

We packaged Jupyter, PaddlePaddle, and various dependency softwares into a Docker image. It frees you from installing these softwares by yourself, and you only need to just install Docker. For various Linux versions, please refer to https://www.docker.com . If you use docker on `Windows <https://www.docker.com/docker-windows>`_ or `Mac <https://www.docker.com/docker-mac>`_ , consider `allocate more Memory and CPU resources to Docker  <http://stackoverflow.com/a/39720010/724872>`_ .


Instructions
======================


This book assumes you are performing CPU training by default. If you want to use GPU training, the steps will vary slightly. Please refer to "GPU Training" below.





CPU training
>>>>>>>>>>>>

Just run these in shell:

..  code-block:: shell

	docker run -d -p 8888:8888 paddlepaddle/book

It downloads the Docker image for running books from DockerHub.com.
To read and edit this book on-line, please visit http://localhost:8888 in your browser.

If the Internet connection to DockerHub.com is compromised, try our spare docker image named docker.paddlepaddlehub.com:

::

	docker run -d -p 8888:8888 docker.paddlepaddlehub.com/book


GPU training
>>>>>>>>>>>>>

To ensure that the GPU driver works properly in the image, we recommend running the image with `nvidia docker <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ . Please install nvidia-docker first, then run:


::

	nvidia-docker run -d -p 8888:8888 paddlepaddle/book:latest-gpu


Or use a image source in China to run:

::

	nvidia-docker run -d -p 8888:8888 docker.paddlepaddlehub.com/book:latest-gpu


modify the following codes

..  code-block:: python

	use_cuda = False


into :

..  code-block:: python

	use_cuda = True



Contribute to Book
===================

We highly appreciate your original contributions of new chapters to Book! Just Pull Requests of your contributions to the sub-directory in :code:`pending` . When this chapter is endorsed, we'll gladly move it to the root directory.


For writing, running, debugging, you need to install `shell <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/blob/develop/.tools/convert-markdown-into-ipynb-and-test.sh>`_ to generate Docker imageã€‚

**Please Note:** We also provide `English Readme <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/blob/develop/README.md>`_ for PaddlePaddle book
