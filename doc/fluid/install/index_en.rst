The first way to install: use pip to install
================================

You can choose any of the four ways to install: "use pip to install", "use Conda to install", "use Docker to install", "compiling from the source code"

This section describes how to use pip to install.

1. You need to confirm that your operating system meets the requirements listed above

2. You need to confirm that your processor meets the requirements listed above

3. Confirm that the Python where you need to install PaddlePaddle is your expected location, because your computer may have multiple Python

    If you are using Python 2, use the following command to output Python path. Depending on your environment, you may need to replace Python in all command lines in the description with specific Python path
    
        In the Windows environment, the command to output Python path is:
        
        ::

            where python

        In the MacOS/Linux environment, the command to output Python path is:

        ::

            which python

    If you are using Python 3, use the following command to output Python path. Depending on your environment, you may need to replace Python in all command lines in the description with specific Python path

        In the Windows environment, the command to output Python path is:

        ::

            where python3

        In the MacOS/Linux environment, the command to output Python path is:

        ::

            which python3

4. Check the version of Python

    If you are using Python 2，confirm it is 2.7.15+ using command

    If you use Python 2
    ::

        python -c "import platform;print(platform.architecture()[0]);print(platform.machine())"

    If you use Python 3
    ::
    
        python3 -c "import platform;print(platform.architecture()[0]);print(platform.machine())"

7. If you want to use `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ to install PaddlePaddle, you can use the command below directly:

        If you are using Python 3, please change **python** in the above command to **python3** and install.

8. Verify installation

    After the installation is complete, you can use `python` or `python3` to enter the Python interpreter and then use `import paddle.fluid as fluid` and then  `fluid.install_check.run_check()` to verify that the installation was successful.

    If `Your Paddle Fluid is installed succesfully!` appears, it means the installation was successful.

4. If you need to create a new Conda virtual environment specifically for Paddle to use (the environment name after --name, you can choose by yourself):

    If you are using Python2 under Window
    
    ::

        conda create --name paddle python=2.7
        activate paddle

    If you are using Python2 under MacOS/Linux

10. Verify installation

    After the installation is complete, you can use `python` or `python3` to enter the Python interpreter and then use `import paddle.fluid as fluid` and then  `fluid.install_check.run_check()` to verify that the installation was successful.

    If `Your Paddle Fluid is installed succesfully!` appears, it means the installation was successful.


11. For more information to help, please refer to:

    `install under conda <install_Conda_en.html>`_


The third way to install: use Docker to install
================================

You can choose any of the four ways to install: "use pip to install", "use Conda to install", "use Docker to install", "compiling from the source code"

This section describes how to use Docker to install.

If you want to use `docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ to install PaddlePaddle, you can use command below:

1. **CPU version**

    (1). At first you need to install `docker <https://www.docker.com>`_

    Note:

        * CentOS 6 not support docker installation

        * processor need supporting MKL

    (2). Pull the image of the preinstalled PaddlePaddle:
    ::

        docker pull hub.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2

    (3). Use the image to build and enter the Docker container:
    ::

        docker run --name paddle -it -v dir1:dir2 hub.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2 /bin/bash

        > --name [Name of container] set the name of Docker;

        > -it The parameter indicates that the container has been operated interactively with the local machine;

        > -v Parameter is used to share files between the host and the container. dir1 is the host directory and dir2 is the directory mounted inside the container. Users can customize their own mounting directory by setting dir1 and dir2.For example, $PWD:/paddle specifies to mount the current path of the host (PWD variable in Linux will expand to the absolute path of the current path) to the /paddle directory inside the container; 

        > hub.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2 is the image name you need to use；/bin/bash is the command to be executed in Docker

2. **GPU version**

    (1). At first you need to install `nvidia-docker <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_

    Note:

        * processor need supporting MKL

        * Your computer needs to have NVIDIA graphics card supporting CUDA driver

        * You need to install `cuDNN <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/>`_ ，version requires 7.3+(For CUDA9/10), 7.1+(For CUDA 8)

        * If you need GPU multi-card mode, you need to install `NCCL 2 <https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl/>`_

            * Only Ubuntu/CentOS support NCCL 2 technology

        * You need to install `CUDA <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-windows/>`_ , depending on your system, there are different requirements for CUDA version:

            * Ubuntu/CentOS 7 ，if you use nvidia-docker to install, CUDA 8.0/9.0/9.1/9.2/10.0 is supported

            * Windows/MacOS/CentOS 6 not support nvidia-docker to install


    (2). Pull the image that supports CUDA 10.0, cuDNN 7.3 + pre installed PaddlePaddle:
    ::

        nvidia-docker pull hub.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2-gpu-cuda10.0-cudnn7

    (3). Use the image to build and enter the docker container:
    ::

        nvidia-docker run --name paddle -it -v dir1:dir2 hub.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2-gpu-cuda10.0-cudnn7 /bin/bash

        > --name [Name of container] set name of Docker;

        > -it The parameter indicates that the container has been operated interactively with the local machine;

        > -v Parameter is used to share files between the host and the container. dir1 is the host directory and dir2 is the directory mounted inside the container. Users can customize their own mounting directory by setting dir1 and dir2.For example, $PWD:/paddle specifies to mount the current path of the host (PWD variable in Linux will expand to the absolute path of the current path) to the /paddle directory inside the container;

        > hub.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2 is the image name you need to use；/bin/bash is the command to be executed in Docker

    Or if you need the version supporting **CUDA 9**, replace **cuda10.0** of the above command with **cuda9.0** 

3. If your machine is not in China's mainland                                                                                                              , you can pull the image directly from DockerHub:

    ::

        docker run --name paddle -it -v dir1:dir2 paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2 /bin/bash

        > --name [Name of container] set name of Docker;

        > -it The parameter indicates that the container has been operated interactively with the local machine;

        > -v Parameter is used to share files between the host and the container. dir1 is the host directory and dir2 is the directory mounted inside the container. Users can customize their own mounting directory by setting dir1 and dir2.For example, $PWD:/paddle specifies to mount the current path of the host (PWD variable in Linux will expand to the absolute path of the current path) to the /paddle directory inside the container; 

        > paddlepaddle/paddle:1.7.2 is the image name you need to use；/bin/bash is the command to be executed in docker

4. Verify installation

    After the installation is complete, you can use `python` or `python3` to enter the Python interpreter and then use `import paddle.fluid as fluid` and then  `fluid.install_check.run_check()` to verify that the installation was successful.

    If `Your Paddle Fluid is installed succesfully!` appears, it means the installation was successful.

The fourth way to install: compile and install with source code
====================================

- If you use PaddlePaddle only, we suggest you to choose one of the three installation methods **pip**, **conda**, **docker** to install.
- If you need to develop PaddlePaddle, please refer to `compile from source code <compile/fromsource.html>`_
